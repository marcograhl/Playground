# 100-days-of-code-log

**Main target:** ***I will code for at least three hours every day for the next 100 days.***

Actually it is a challenge for 100 days to make a habit of everyday coding to develop my skill sets.  I inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway "Alexander Kallaway") #100DaysOfCode challenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/ "100daysofcode.com") or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "the official repo").
